# Overview

I like Mairo so I think making a platform game in C# would be a good project.
I will develop a straightforward platform game using the C# programming language within Visual Studio. This game will feature collectible points, jumpable blocks, and an exit door to conclude each level. This serves as an introductory-level project for a platform game, and we encourage you to consider creating additional levels once the initial one is finished. Furthermore, I will incorporate moving platforms that traverse left, right, up, and down within the game. Players will navigate these platforms, transforming the experience into an engaging and interactive game, all accomplished exclusively through Windows Forms and C# programming.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
